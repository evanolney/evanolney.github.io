          Software Development
          <p>
            I want to create software for making life a little more livable through efficiency and accessibility. By finding a way to make information easily accessible and comprehensible, everyday life can become more about what we want to do, rather than what we should be doing. Once I have projects available, they will be displayed below.

          Game Development
          <p>
            Creating games has fueled my creativity since my youth. It has been a way to explore the boundaries of entertainment while straddling the line between stress and leisure. Lately I've been interested in the use of video games to indirectly impart useful knowledge and skills for real world utilization.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          Travel
          <p>
            My experience abroad has fueled my desire to explore the world. These adventures will allow me to experience other cultures and understandings while simultaneously attempting to explain my own. I know I will learn about others and myself, and hope the people I meet will do the same.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          Languages
          <p>
            From learning a little bit of several languages, I have come to understand the impact of language on perspective and  culture. The lure of multilingualism extends beyond its cultural impact and into self improvement, including intellectual training, opportunity expansion, and even coded expression. Although I prefer not to hide behind the language barrier, sometimes it is nice to have other ways of expressing oneself verbally.
            <br>
            Lond story short, I am interested in learning more languages. With limited academic experience with Spanish, ASL, and Korean, and some self study of Japanese, I do not have any languages I can consider myself conversational save for American English.
